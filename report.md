I've learned the basics of git and will be getting to learn more about github. I've also learned the basics of html and how important the structure of the code is. It was interesting to see the changes being done on Visual Studio Code (or any IDE) gets shows on github when you've cloned the repository on your local machine and published/pushed the changes to your linked account on github. This is definitely easier for teamwork on projects.
